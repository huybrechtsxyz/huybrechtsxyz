= Environment

The environment of the website is designed to ensure high performance, scalability, and security. This setup consists of several core components, including web servers, databases, DNS (Domain Name System) configuration, and associated applications, which all work in unison to deliver a seamless user experience.

== Domain configuration

=== Domain setup

The website is set up using a structure that follows the pattern: {application}.{environment}.{domain}. Here's a breakdown of how this setup works and how DNS and Traefik can be configured to handle routing: *{application}.{environment}.{domain}* Example: For an API running in the staging environment, the URL would look like api.staging.example.com.

- *{application}:* Refers to specific services or components of the site, such as api, admin, or app.
- *{environment}:* Represents the environment in which the application is deployed, such as development, test, staging, or production. This allows for different instances of the same application to coexist across environments. For production the environment is skipped.
- *{domain}:* The main domain for the website, like example.com.

DNS records are configured to map subdomains (e.g., api.staging.example.com) to the server or load balancer where the application is hosted. You create CNAME or A records for each application-environment combination. Traefik dynamically manages these routes, handling SSL certificates (via Let's Encrypt) and load balancing as needed. For instance:

- api.staging.example.com → CNAME or A record pointing to the server's IP or Traefik's load balancer.
- admin.example.com → CNAME or A record pointing to a different IP or Traefik instance handling the production environment.

DNS resolves the requested domain (e.g., api.staging.example.com) to the IP where Traefik is running. Traefik inspects the incoming request, checks the hostname, and applies the matching routing rule to direct the request to the corresponding application and environment.

=== Domain overview

The table below provides a structured view of the domain configuration for the website. It outlines the various applications (e.g., web, API, admin, blog) across different environments, such as production and staging. Each domain is associated with a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that is used to access the respective service in its environment.

This domain map helps visualize how traffic is routed based on the application and environment, ensuring a clear separation between production and development environments while maintaining an organized domain structure.

== Environment configuration

The environment configuration for our application is structured to facilitate development, testing, and production processes, ensuring stability and reliability at each stage. The *development environment*, referred to as *DEV*, serves as a space for developers to build and test new features, enabling quick iterations and immediate feedback. 

The *testing environment* is labeled as *TST* and is *unstable*. This is where new code changes are rigorously evaluated to identify potential issues before they reach the staging phase. This environment is essential for running various tests, including unit, integration, and performance tests, allowing for thorough examination of features and functionalities in a controlled setting. In this environment, there is no concern for data stability, as it is primarily focused on code changes and functionality testing, often using mock data or temporary datasets. *Data is regularly reset or reinitialized!*

The *staging environment* is designed to be*stable*, serving as a replica of the production environment. It provides a safe platform for final testing and quality assurance, ensuring that all features perform as expected under conditions that closely mirror the live environment. This allows the team to validate data migrations, integrations, and other features before they are pushed to production, reducing the risk of issues once live. *Data is regularly reset or reinitialized!*

Finally, the *production environment* is the *stable* release version of the application. It is the environment where the application is made available to end-users, and utmost reliability is crucial. By clearly defining these environments, we establish a robust framework for development, testing, and deployment, ultimately leading to higher quality applications and enhanced user satisfaction. In this environment, data stability is paramount; all data is secure, regularly backed up, and kept intact to ensure user trust and application reliability. Proper measures are in place to protect sensitive information and maintain the integrity of user data, ensuring that the application runs smoothly and efficiently for its intended audience.

=== Environments and secrets

In modern application development, managing sensitive information such as credentials, API keys, and configuration settings is crucial for maintaining security and integrity. All environment variables (envvars) in our setup are utilized as secrets to protect sensitive data from exposure in code repositories and during runtime. These secrets are securely stored in GitHub environment secrets, ensuring that access is restricted and controlled.

The deployment process is managed through our CI/CD pipeline, which automatically retrieves and injects these secrets into the application as needed. This streamlined approach enhances security by ensuring that sensitive information is not hard-coded into files or directly exposed in the source code.

Below is an overview of all the secrets utilized in the pipeline, as well as those defined in Docker Compose files and application configuration files. They are maintained for each environment.

[cols="1,1,2,1", options="header"]

| REGISTRY_USERNAME | Secret | Container registry username      | user1
| REGISTRY_PASSWORD | Secret | Container registry password      | 1234
|====

=== Application structure

The application is organized into a structured directory layout that facilitates efficient management and scalability. At the top level, the app directory contains several key subdirectories:

app
 ├── cert +
 ├── data +
 │ ├── pgadmin +
 │ └── pgdata +
 └── logs +

- cert: This folder is designated for storing SSL/TLS certificates, and encryption keys ensuring secure communication between the application and its users.
- data: This directory houses critical data components. Within it, there are two important subdirectories:
  * pgadmin: This subdirectory contains configuration and data files specific to pgAdmin, the PostgreSQL database management tool, facilitating database administration.
  * pgdata: This folder is used to store the actual PostgreSQL database data files, ensuring persistence and integrity of the database.
- logs: This directory is responsible for storing application log files, which are essential for monitoring application performance and troubleshooting issues.

== Continuous integration and delivery

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are essential practices in modern software development that promote rapid and reliable delivery of applications. CI involves the frequent integration of code changes into a shared repository, often facilitated by version control systems like Git. This process allows developers to detect and fix issues early, improving code quality and accelerating the development cycle.

In our workflow, when a code change is merged into the main branch of the Git repository, a CI pipeline is automatically triggered. This pipeline runs a series of tests to ensure that the new changes do not introduce any bugs or regressions, maintaining the stability of the codebase.

In addition to the automated pipeline for testing, we have separate pipelines for deploying to the staging and production environments. However, these pipelines are run manually to ensure that deployments are deliberate and well-coordinated, allowing for additional checks and balances before changes are pushed to these critical environments. This structured approach to CI/CD enables a smoother development process while ensuring the reliability and quality of the application at every stage.

=== Automated environment deployment

The deployment process for an environment is orchestrated through a series of well-defined jobs within a CI/CD pipeline. When a deployment is triggered, the workflow initiates the following sequence of actions:

1. *Initialization of the Server*: If specified, the pipeline begins by executing the *init-server* job, which connects to the target server via SSH. This job ensures that essential packages, including Docker and Docker Compose, are installed and configured. Additionally, it sets up the firewall rules to enhance security, ensuring that the server is ready for subsequent operations.

2. *Server Update*: The *update-server* job is executed next, which updates the server configuration. It creates necessary application directories if they do not already exist and handles Docker secrets management. Secrets, such as database credentials and API keys, are checked and created as Docker secrets to ensure secure access during deployment.

3. *Building the Website*: The *build-website* job compiles the application, restoring dependencies, building the project, and running tests to ensure functionality. Upon successful completion, the Docker image for the website is built and pushed to a Docker registry.

4. *Deploy Generic Configuration*: The *deploy-generic* job follows, where configuration files specific to the environment (e.g., `src/compose.${{ inputs.environment }}.yml`) are transferred to the server using SCP (Secure Copy Protocol). This setup prepares the environment for deployment.

5. *Deployment of Docker Swarm Stack*: Finally, depending on the specified input, either *deploy-stack-build* or *deploy-stack-nobuild* jobs are executed. These jobs deploy the Docker stack using the configuration file specific to the environment, initiating the application services defined in the Compose file. This ensures that the application is up and running in the desired environment.

Throughout this process, logs are maintained to track deployment activities, helping with troubleshooting and monitoring the health of the application. The entire deployment cycle is structured to ensure reliability, security, and a seamless transition from code changes to a live application environment.
