# Minio

aka minio

MinIO is an open-source, high-performance, object storage system compatible with the Amazon S3 API. It is designed for large-scale data storage, handling unstructured data such as photos, videos, and backups across distributed systems. MinIO provides high availability and fault tolerance by allowing data to be stored and replicated across multiple nodes. Its scalability, combined with fast read/write operations, makes it ideal for cloud-native applications, machine learning, and big data workloads. MinIO can be deployed on-premises, in hybrid clouds, or as part of containerized environments like Kubernetes.

Minio is used as storage service.
