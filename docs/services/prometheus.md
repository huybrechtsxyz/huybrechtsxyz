# Prometheus Monitoring

## Introduction

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. In our system, Prometheus is used to collect metrics from various services, store them efficiently, and enable real-time alerting and visualization.

## Key Features in Our Setup

1. **Metrics Collection**: Aggregates metrics from:
   - Application services.
   - System-level metrics.
   - Third-party services via exporters.

2. **Alerting**: Configured with rules for real-time notifications via [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/).

3. **Data Visualization**: Integrated with [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for rich, customizable dashboards.

4. **Scalability**: Supports high availability and long-term storage of metrics.

## Architecture Overview

1. **Prometheus Server**: 
   - Scrapes metrics from targets (defined in `prometheus.yml`).
   - Stores data in a time-series database.

2. **Exporters**:
   - **Node Exporter**: System metrics (CPU, memory, disk).
   - **Custom Exporters**: Application-specific metrics.
   - **Third-party Exporters**: Databases, cloud services.

3. **Alertmanager**:
   - Manages alert notifications.
   - Routes alerts to email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Metrics visualized in Grafana using Prometheus as a data source.

- **Go** (if building Prometheus from source).

### Steps

#### 1. Install Prometheus
- Using Docker:
  ```bash
