# Prometheus Integration for Monitoring

This section explains how **Prometheus** is used for monitoring and collecting metrics from the services in this project, particularly **Traefik**.

## What is Prometheus?

**Prometheus** is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It collects time-series data from configured endpoints, stores it in a time-series database, and provides a query language (PromQL) to retrieve and analyze the data.

### Features of Prometheus

- **Multi-dimensional data model**: Time series are identified by metric name and key/value pairs (labels).
- **Powerful querying**: PromQL allows users to query and aggregate time-series data.
- **Alerting**: Prometheus can trigger alerts based on specific conditions in the data.
- **Easy integration**: Prometheus integrates easily with modern microservices, containerized environments, and cloud-native architectures.

## Prometheus and Traefik

In this project, **Traefik** is configured to expose **Prometheus metrics**, which Prometheus scrapes to monitor the performance and health of the Traefik reverse proxy.

### How it works

1. **Traefik** exposes metrics at the `/metrics` endpoint.
2. **Prometheus** is configured to scrape this metrics endpoint.
3. Prometheus collects data from Traefik, stores it in its time-series database, and makes it available for querying and visualization.

## Configuration in Docker Compose

In our Docker Compose setup, we have added a **Prometheus** service that collects metrics from **Traefik**. Below are the key configurations:

### Prometheus Configuration (`prometheus.yml`)

Prometheus is configured to scrape the metrics exposed by **Traefik** at `http://traefik:8080/metrics`. The scrape interval is set to 15 seconds. Below is the relevant part of the configuration:

    ```yaml
    global:
    scrape_interval: 15s  # How often to scrape the metrics

    scrape_configs:
    - job_name: 'traefik'
        metrics_path: /metrics
        static_configs:
        - targets: ['traefik:8080']  # The Traefik service endpoint to scrape metrics from
    ```
