# PostgreSQL

aka postgres

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system known for its stability, flexibility, and support for advanced data types and operations. It supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. PostgreSQL is ACID-compliant, ensuring reliable transactions, and includes features such as indexing, full-text search, and support for complex queries and joins. Itâ€™s widely used for handling large-scale, high-availability databases, and is known for its extensibility, allowing developers to add custom functions and data types.
