Yes, if you want to access the proxy.develop.huybrechts.dev domain (or any other "fake" domain like develop.huybrechts.dev) on your local laptop and it's not yet resolvable via public DNS, you will need to modify your local host file. This is required for local development or testing purposes when DNS records for custom domains aren't available externally.
Steps to Update Your Laptop's Hosts File:

    Edit the Hosts File:
        On your laptop, you'll need to update the hosts file to map proxy.develop.huybrechts.dev (and any other domains like *.develop.huybrechts.dev) to the appropriate IP address.
        The hosts file allows your machine to map domain names to IP addresses locally, without relying on DNS servers.

    Determine the IP Address:
        If you are running your services (like Traefik) in Docker, and you want to access them via proxy.develop.huybrechts.dev, use the IP address of the machine running Traefik (or your Docker host if you're using Docker on your laptop).
        For example, if you're running Docker on your laptop and Traefik is listening on localhost or 127.0.0.1, you can map the domain to 127.0.0.1.

    Edit Hosts File Location:
        On Windows: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
        On macOS/Linux: /etc/hosts

    You'll need administrative or root permissions to modify this file.

    Add Domain Mappings:
        Open the file with an editor (use sudo on macOS/Linux if required, or run the editor as Administrator on Windows).
        Add lines that map proxy.develop.huybrechts.dev and any other local domains to the IP of your machine (for local testing, you can use 127.0.0.1 if the service is on the same laptop).

    Example for hosts file:

127.0.0.1    proxy.develop.huybrechts.dev
127.0.0.1    develop.huybrechts.dev
127.0.0.1    *.develop.huybrechts.dev

This will map proxy.develop.huybrechts.dev (and any other subdomains of develop.huybrechts.dev) to 127.0.0.1, which is your local machine.

Save the File:

    After editing and saving the hosts file, you'll need to clear any DNS cache to ensure that the changes take effect immediately.

Flush DNS Cache:

    On macOS/Linux: Run the following command in the terminal:

sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder  # for macOS
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved  # for some Linux distros

On Windows: Run the following in Command Prompt as Administrator:

        ipconfig /flushdns

    Verify the Changes:
        Open a web browser and try accessing http://proxy.develop.huybrechts.dev or any other custom domain you set up.
        It should route to the corresponding service (like Traefik or MinIO) running on your laptop.

Example Case:

    If Traefik is running locally on your laptop: You would add 127.0.0.1 proxy.develop.huybrechts.dev in the hosts file. This allows your browser to resolve proxy.develop.huybrechts.dev to your local machine (where Traefik and your services are running).

When Do You Need to Do This?

    For Local Testing: You need to update your hosts file if you're using custom domains like proxy.develop.huybrechts.dev locally, and if those domains aren't publicly resolvable by DNS yet.
    If DNS is Not Available: If you haven't configured the DNS to route requests to your laptop or reverse proxy yet, the hosts file will ensure local access.

When Not to Do This:

    Public DNS Resolution: If you've already configured public DNS for proxy.develop.huybrechts.dev to resolve to the correct IP address (via a DNS provider), you do not need to modify the hosts file on your laptop. The domain will be resolved publicly by the DNS server.

In summary, yes, you need to update the hosts file on your laptop if you're testing custom domains locally without a publicly available DNS record. This will allow your laptop to correctly resolve the domain to the right IP address.
