# âœ… SSH Setup Verification Commands (Ubuntu Server)

This document contains commands to verify if SSH is properly installed, running, and accessible remotely. Also includes troubleshooting tips if you're using CI/CD pipelines with caching.

---

## 1. Check if OpenSSH is Installed

```bash
dpkg -l | grep openssh-server
If nothing is returned, install it with:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server -y

2. Check SSH Service Status

sudo systemctl status ssh

You should see: Active: active (running)

To start and enable it:

sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl enable ssh

3. Check SSH Listening Port

sudo ss -tuln | grep :22

Expected output:

LISTEN 0 128 0.0.0.0:22 ...

If you only see 127.0.0.1:22, SSH is not listening publicly.
4. Verify SSH Listen Address in Config

grep ^ListenAddress /etc/ssh/sshd_config

If you see ListenAddress 127.0.0.1, change it to:

ListenAddress 0.0.0.0

Then restart the service:

sudo systemctl restart ssh

5. Test from Another Machine

From your local machine or CI runner:

ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no root@<your-server-ip>

Or use scp:

scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no somefile root@<your-server-ip>:/root/

6. Firewall Checks (Optional)
UFW:

sudo ufw status
sudo ufw allow ssh

IPTables:

sudo iptables -L -n

7. Cloud Provider Firewall (e.g. Kamatera)

Ensure port 22 is open for inbound traffic in Kamatera's network/firewall settings.
8. ðŸ§¹ Clear CI/CD Cache (If Using Caching)

If you're using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar and SSH still fails unexpectedly:

    Change the cache key in your workflow config.

    Delete existing cache manually in the CI web UI.

    Or add a cleanup step:

rm -rf ~/.ssh/known_hosts ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Clearing the cache can resolve issues with stale SSH keys or host fingerprint mismatches.
âœ… All set! If you see no errors and can connect, SSH is working properly.


Let me know if you want this exported to a file or formatted for a particular CI system.
